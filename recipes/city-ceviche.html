        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This city ceviche recipe is an excellent appetizer to enjoy with friends when San Francisco's Indian summers warm up the city. While marinating in citrus juice overnight is the way to "cook" fish in ceviche, I found that the poaching process is faster and the best and easiest way to judge if it's cooked. I often buy precooked shrimp (not frozen!) and poach the scallops. It's best served with cold beer (we prefer Pacifico) and fresh limes. Using quality and sturdy tortilla chips is essential. Please note that the serving size is meant for appetizer portions.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces sea scallops</li>
            <li>8 ounces shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh orange juice</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 yellow bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup diced seeded tomato</li>
            <li>1/2 cup halved, thinly sliced red onion</li>
            <li>1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 small serrano chile pepper, seeded and minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated orange zest</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
            <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 avocado, diced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water; set aside. Remove and discard tough side muscles from scallops, if necessary. Slice scallops in half horizontally.</li>
            <li>Fill a 1-quart saucepan 3/4 full with salted water; bring to a boil. Add scallops; reduce heat to a low simmer. Poach until just cooked through, about 1 minute. Transfer scallops using a slotted spoon to the bowl of ice water to stop the cooking.</li>
            <li>Return water to a boil. Add shrimp; poach until opaque and pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer shrimp using a slotted spoon to the same bowl of ice water to stop the cooking</li>
            <li>Drain scallops and shrimp; pat dry with paper towels. Transfer to a glass, ceramic, or other non-reactive bowl. Stir in lime juice and orange juice. Cover bowl; refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain and discard juice from seafood, leaving it just moist. Add bell peppers, tomato, red onion, cilantro, serano, orange zest, cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt; refrigerate 30 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in avocado and drizzle with oil just before serving. Serve in martini glasses or stemmed margarita glasses.</li>
