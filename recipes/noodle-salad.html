        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This amazing salad recipe was given to me by a friend who used to know someone at the now closed Larry's Markets in the Seattle area. I've added to the recipe a little -- so it's not exactly the same... but better! I take this to every picnic and everyone loves it! May also add diced chicken for a variation.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hot chili oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds, or more if desired</li>
            <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the angel hair pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
            <li>Whisk together the sesame oil, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, chili oil, and sugar in a large bowl. Toss the pasta in the dressing, then sprinkle with sesame seeds, green onion, and bell pepper. Serve warm, or cover and refrigerate for a cold salad.</li>
        </ol>
